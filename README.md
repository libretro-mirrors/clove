CLove
=====
CLove is a simple, easy to learn and use 2D game framework tested on
Mac/Linux/Windows/Web, made in C with OpenGLES 2 which uses Lua and FH as scripting language.

How to build
============
On Windows:
- Download and install mingw and let the setup configure the path for you.
Open up the CMD and type gcc if you get an error then type this: setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\MinGW\bin;" . That command will add
the bin folder to the path.
After that check if you got gcc & g++ installed.
- Download and install CMake and let the setup configure the path for you.
- Make a new directory called build inside CLove and call:
cmake ../ -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER:PATH=C:/MinGW/bin/gcc.exe -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER:PATH=C:/MinGW/bin/g++.exe . If this command
does not work then go in C:\Program Files\CMake\bin and open up cmake-gui.exe. Tell it where is CLove and where you want to build the   project. Also do not forget to use custom compiler that is set to GCC as C compiler and G++ as the C++ compiler.
After that use the make command and that's it( if you get errors that make does not exist then paste this into CMD terminal:
		copy c:\MinGW\bin\mingw32-make.exe c:\MinGW\bin\make.exe )
- Download DX SDK 2010 only if you get errors from SDL when building: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812
- After you have succesfuly build CLove go into src/3rdparty directory and copy: SDL2, openal .dll in the same directory where clove.exe is.


On Linux and OS X:
	- Download and install cmake,gcc,g++(optional git)(on OSX you can install these using brew)
	- Go inside CLove/ and call ./build_linux.sh or ./build_osx.sh
	- On Debian based you must have install:
	sudo apt-get install freeglut3 freeglut3-dev libglew1.5 libglew1.5-dev
	libglu1-mesa libglu1-mesa-dev libgl1-mesa-glx libgl1-mesa-dev libasound2-dev
	libaudio-dev libesd0-dev libpulse-dev libroar-dev
	- On Redhat: mesa-libGL mesa-libGL-devel and stable/devel versions of mesa glu


	For Web:
	- Install emscripten(1.38.15, commit 7a0e27441eda6cb0e3f1210e6837cae4b080ab4c) and add it to your path.
	- Run ./build_web.sh .When it's done you will have "clove.bc" and other files. The .bc file is used
	for linking with your C/C++ programs, the rest is used for Lua.
	- For testing you have the following options:
1. Copy generated files into /var/www/html/ and run localhost (you must have installed apache2)
	1. Open a terminal and run: python3 -m http.server . Run index.html and go to localhost:8000


	NOTE:
	CLove might work with other version of emscripten but I haven't tested!
	Inside the build scripts you can disable/enable Lua and Physfs.
	When you want to release a project you must modify build_web.sh to preload your files.

	- Image creation from scratch or from a template & save(png,bmp,tga).
	- Meshes.
	- Sound loading and playing (Vorbis and Wav).
	- Streaming support for Vorbis files.
	- Primitive drawing.
	- UI module.
	- Filesystem functions.
	- OpenGL ES 2.0.
	- Networking, (unix only, TCP with IPv4 or IPv6, WIP).
	- Powerful font loading and drawing using batch system.
	- Support for image fonts.
	- Keyboard, mouse and joystick support.
	- Thread (WIP).

	Examples
	--------

	Lua:

	```lua
	-- Example of drawing an image
	local image = love.graphics.newImage("image.png")

	function love.draw()
		love.graphics.draw(image, 200, 200)
	end
	```

	```lua
	-- Example of drawing some primitives
	function love.draw()
		love.graphics.rectangle("fill", 100, 100, 32, 16)
		love.graphics.rectangle("line", 200, 200, 32, 32)
		love.graphics.circle("fill", 270, 200, 32, 16)
		love.graphics.circle("line", 300, 100, 32, 8)
	end
	```

	```lua
	-- Example of playing music
	local ogg_music = love.audio.newSource("music.ogg")
	function love.load()
		ogg_music:play()
	end
	```

	FH:

	```php
	# Example of drawing an image
	fn love_load() {
		let self = {};
		self.image = love_graphics_newImage("image.png");

		love_draw(self);

		return self;
	}

	fn love_draw(self) {
		love_graphics_draw(self.image, 200, 200);
	}
```

```php
# Example of drawing some primitives
fn love_draw() {
	love_graphics_rectangle("fill", 100, 100, 32, 16);
	love_graphics_rectangle("line", 200, 200, 32, 32);
	love_graphics_circle("fill", 270, 200, 32, 16);
	love_graphics_circle("line", 300, 100, 32, 8);
}
```

```php
# Example of playing music
fn love_load() {
	let self = {}
	self.ogg_music = love_audio_newSource("music.ogg")

	self.ogg_music = love.audio.newSource("music.ogg");
	love_audio_play(self.ogg_music);

	return self;
}
```
