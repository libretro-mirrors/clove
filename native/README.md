# Native

The purpose of this folder is to create custom classes or even games for CLove
written in C or C++.
This gives you the possibility to not use Lua if you want or make parts of the
game in C/C++ and/or in Lua.

#Note

You must call all your draw, update and load functions inside game.c from where
CLove will handle the code inside src/main.c
